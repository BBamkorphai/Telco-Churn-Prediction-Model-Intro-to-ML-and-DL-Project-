# Project Title

Telco Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This project is part of the Intro to Machine Learning and Deep Learning course.
The main objective is to analyze the Telco Customer Churn Dataset and develop predictive models to understand key drivers of customer churn and forecast churn probability.

## Dataset

Source: Telco Customer Churn - Kaggle

Description: The dataset contains information about a telecommunication company’s customers, including demographics, account information, services subscribed, and churn labels.

Problem Definition

## Task:

Explore and analyze the dataset to extract insights.

Define a business problem statement based on churn prediction.

Identify and describe the purpose of selected features (at least 5 attributes).

Assess feature importance to explain model interpretability.

Implement predictive models to classify churn vs. non-churn customers.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Handle missing values and categorical encoding.

Feature scaling and transformation.

Feature importance analysis to identify key drivers of churn.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Customer distribution analysis.

Correlation between churn and service attributes.

Storytelling through feature insights.

### Model Development
Models are built using both from-scratch functions and machine learning libraries.

Regression Models:

Linear Regression

Multiple Regression

Polynomial Regression

Classification Models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest (Ensemble Learning)

Naïve Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Means & Agglomerative Clustering (Unsupervised)

Perceptron & Single-layer Perceptron (SLP)

Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)

Dimensionality Reduction: Applied for SVM and Random Forest where appropriate.

### Model Training & Evaluation

Training and testing iterations with batch runs.

Models saved and reloaded for testing consistency.

## Evaluation Metrics

Performance is evaluated using multiple metrics:

Loss curves

Confusion Matrix

Accuracy

Precision, Recall (Sensitivity), Specificity, True Negative Rate

F1-Score

ROC Curve & AUC

R-Square (for regression tasks)

Benchmarking plots (accuracy/loss curves)

## Results

Key features influencing churn identified.

Classification models compared in terms of predictive performance.

Visualization of performance metrics provided for benchmarking.

## Future Work

Explore deep learning architectures (e.g., CNN, RNN) for churn prediction.

Apply advanced feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques.

Extend project to handle streaming or real-time customer churn detection.
